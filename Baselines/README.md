# Baselines
We use four baselines to take a performance comparison with our AMCoEdge method as the following.
1) RandCoEdge: A random-based method that randomly selects an ES to collaboratively process each task with the local ES. The code of this method is stored to the RandCoEdge directory.
3) DRLCoEdge: A representative DRL-based method that selects an ES to collaboratively process each task with the local ES based on DRL. The code of this method is stored to the DRLCoEdge directory.
4) SMCoEdge: A state-of-the-art method that simultaneously selects suitable k ESs to collaboratively process each offloading task based on top-k DQN model. However, although the k can be previously adjusted by the user, it is fixed in execution. In our experiment, we keep the same setting k = 3 in original paper. The code of this method is stored to the SMCoEdge directory and its source code is released at https://github.com/ChangfuXu/SMCoEdge.
5) Optimal: An optimal method that greedily selects the most suitable ESs to collaboratively process each task by enumerating all action spaces. However, this method is infeasible since the scheduler can not know the available computing and networking resources of ESs in the practical MEC system. The code of this method is stored to the Optimal directory.
